# connect-four
An assignment for the Testing Ruby with RSpec section of the The Odin Project. The purpose of this project is to get practice applying Test-Driven Development principles and engaging in Red-Green-Refactor development.

# Features
* A UI that is updated every turn
* Score tracking
* Consecutive pieces checked every turn for victory
* Automatic game over/reset if board is full

# Reflections
This project allowed me to practice RSpec and engage with Test-Driven Development for the first time. I also got more practice with OOP and using Git, especially branches, rebasing and merging. I still have a lot to learn about testing but I feel better prepared for tackling future projects the TDD way.
